# Yet another To do list

Because there's only so many ways of saying hello world

---

Features:

- Add items to your list (wow)
- Click on said items to move them between the "To do" and "Done" lists beautifully crafted styles differentiating each list
- Delete individual items (kind of\*\*)
- Delete the entire list (also kind of\*\*)
- Save your lists in your browsers' local storage for future use (deleting the list clears this too)

\*\* The items aren't really deleted, but instead set as inactive and thus won't render. I opted to do this because I hoard data... force of habit.

Known bugs:

- Event listener to set item as completed don't work
- If 2 list items have the same name, clicking on one affects the other
